→ Consider **each intersection** for both **Light (+)** and **Dark (−)** implications.

## 🔢 Scoring System

**Magnitude (1–10)**: Size of impact  
**Valence (−5 to +5)**: Direction of impact

| Magnitude  | Description           |
|------------|-----------------------|
| 1–3        | Minimal                |
| 4–6        | Moderate               |
| 7–8        | Significant            |
| 9–10       | Transformative         |

| Valence    | Description            |
|------------|------------------------|
| −5 to −3   | Strongly Negative      |
| −2 to −1   | Somewhat Negative      |
| 0          | Neutral                |
| +1 to +2   | Somewhat Positive      |
| +3 to +5   | Strongly Positive      |

## 🛠️ Best Practices

- ✅ Cover **all 30 intersections**
- ✅ Use **concrete examples**, not abstractions
- ✅ Include **specific mitigation strategies**
- ✅ Keep **balanced light/dark** analysis
- ✅ Highlight **edge cases** and vulnerable groups

---

## 🚩 Common Pitfalls

- ❌ Tech Determinism: *Context matters*
- ❌ Elite Lens: *Broaden the perspective*
- ❌ Present Bias: *Think long-term*
- ❌ Generic Outputs: *Be precise and practical*

---

## 🎓 For Academic & Onboarding Use

- 📘 **Slide Decks**: Use matrix visual for layout
- 🎯 **Assign** each team member a domain or sphere
- 🧠 **Workshops**: Score 3–5 key impacts together
- 🧪 **Research**: Use framework for cross-tech comparison
- ✍️ **Reports**: Include table + summary + Latin quote

## 📋 Self-Check Before Submission

- [ ] Did I score all 30 cells?
- [ ] Are the examples specific?
- [ ] Are both harms and benefits well-covered?
- [ ] Are recommendations practical?
- [ ] Did I consider vulnerable or future populations?
