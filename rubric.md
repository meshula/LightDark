# Didactic Rubric Specification: Ethical Technology Assessment Framework

## Executive Summary

This specification defines a comprehensive didactic rubric for teaching ethical technology assessment using the Black Mirror/Light Mirror epistemological framework. The rubric integrates Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory with Ian Malcolm's cautionary wisdom about technological hubris, creating a structured learning methodology for evaluating the societal impact of emerging technologies.

## Epistemological Foundation

### Core Philosophical Principles

1. **Fallibilist Epistemology**: Knowledge about technology's impact is provisional and subject to revision
2. **Systems Thinking**: Technology exists within interconnected ecological systems of influence
3. **Temporal Awareness**: Effects manifest across multiple time horizons (chronosystem)
4. **Ethical Pragmatism**: Analysis must lead to actionable recommendations
5. **Reflexive Skepticism**: Continuous questioning of assumptions and justifications

### Knowledge Construction Framework

The rubric employs a constructivist approach where learners build understanding through:
- **Experiential Analysis**: Direct engagement with technology assessment scenarios
- **Collaborative Evaluation**: Peer review and discussion of impact matrices
- **Iterative Refinement**: Multiple assessment cycles with feedback integration
- **Metacognitive Reflection**: Explicit awareness of reasoning processes

*"Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should."* — Ian Malcolm

The wisdom embedded in this cautionary observation forms the ethical foundation of our didactic approach: technology assessment must integrate both capability analysis and moral reasoning to serve human flourishing and ecological sustainability.
